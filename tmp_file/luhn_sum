@010$ Here we enlist the 10 best games Ubisoft has produced during its thirty years of existence: @010$ Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege – Gameplay Trailer Fall 2015 @010$ The long-awaited successor to the cancelled Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots was met with favorable reception albeit opinions altered regarding the game’s merits and defects, the chief complaint being the game’s unsatisfactory content that leaves players wanting as well as minor issues which frequent online multiplayer shooters such as clunky map rotation and a shortage of in-game communication tools for console players.
Instead of another extreme multiplayer shooter, Ubisoft substitutes guns with strenuous third-person sword fighting, a multi-faction badass campaign coupled with methodical, thought-provoking, challenging gameplay as you enter the battlefield as a merciless Viking, agile Samurai or chivalric Knight.
@010$ Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands Reveal Trailer – E3 2015 @010$ Set for a March 7th, 2017 release, the anticipated follow-up to the 2012 tactical squad-based shooter Future Soldier has the underlying potential to skyrocket the series to new heights.
@010$ Wildlands has all the compulsory ingredients to become a revolutionary entry to the Ghost Recon series and a unique reimagining of shooters like Infinite Warfare, with its alluring storyline, astonishing graphics, a modern-day setting and promising open-world approach with a plethora of side missions and areas just begging for exploration, reminiscent of Far Cry and Grand Theft Auto.
@010$ Assassin's Creed Revelations - E3 Trailer Extended Cut @010$ Back in 2011, Assassin’s Creed: Revelations was regarded as the most compelling entry in the series, bringing a faithful and heartfelt closure to gaming’s two most memorable protagonists - Ezio Auditore and Altair Ibn-La'Ahad.
In the end, Ubisoft’s efforts paid off adequately, its strongly developed characters, convincing voice acting, masterful soundtrack and stunning visual design made Revelations the pinnacle of the series’ storytelling method in 2011, despite the fact the game hasn’t revolutionized any of the game’s core aspects which have remained repetitive and worn-out for many years.
A very respectable RPG in its own right with lengthy customization options and turn-based combat, The Stick of Truth feels more like an interactive South Park movie.
@010$ Far Cry 3 is a mature, tempestuous and unpredictable story featuring flawed, morally grey, complex leading heroes and anti-heroes.
@010$ Splinter Cell: Blacklist - Launch Trailer @010$ Splinter Cell: Blacklist represents a mirror of a different side of Sam Fisher; while Splinter Cell: Conviction was a personal story, Blacklist emphasizes not who Sam is, but what he does.
@010$ Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag - Official Launch Trailer @010$ Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is the second addition to the series’ so-called Kenway Saga, after 2012’s Assassin’s Creed III.
Date of Birth @010$ Copyright© 2017 GamersDecide Inc. All rights reserved @010$ Ubisoft Entertainment SA (formerly Ubi Soft Entertainment Software) is a French video game publisher, headquartered in Rennes, France.
It is known for publishing games for several acclaimed video game franchises including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Just Dance, Prince of Persia, Rayman, and Tom Clancy's.
[4] @011$ In March 1986, five brothers of the Guillemot family founded Ubi Soft in Carentoir, a small village located in the Morbihan department of the Brittany region in France.
By the end of the decade, Ubi Soft began expanding to other markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.
@011$ In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Ubi Soft committed itself to online games by supporting Uru: Ages Beyond Myst, The Matrix Online, and the European and Chinese operation of EverQuest.
@011$ In March 2001, Gores Technology Group sold The Learning Company's entertainment division (which includes games originally published by Brøderbund, Mattel, Mindscape and Strategic Simulations) to them.
[15] In a presentation during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016, Yves Guillemot stressed the importance that Ubisoft remain an independent company to maintain its creative freedom.
[16] @011$ Vivendi also acquired stake in mobile game publisher Gameloft, also owned by the Guillemots, at the same time it started acquiring Ubisoft shares.
[17][15] In the following February, Vivendi acquired €500 million worth of shares in Gameloft, gaining more than 30% of the shares and requiring the company under French law to make a public tender offer; this action enabled Vivendi to complete the hostile takeover of Gameloft by June 2016.
[24] @011$ By the time of Ubisoft's annual board meeting in September 2016, Vivendi has gained 23% of the shares, while Guillemots were able to increase their voting share to 20%.
[27] The Guillemot family has since raised their stake in Ubisoft; as of June 2017, the family now held 13.6 percent of Ubisoft's share capital, and 20.02 percent of the company's voting rights.
[28] @011$ Besides publishing their own games, Ubisoft is also publishing famous franchises produced by other important studios for some specific platforms.
@011$ Uplay is a digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer and communications service for PC created by Ubisoft.
[38] @011$ In January 2010, Ubisoft announced the online services platform Uplay, which forces customers to not only authenticate on the first game launch, but to remain online continually while playing, with the game even pausing if network connection is lost.
[47] @011$ On 2 July 2013, Ubisoft announced a major breach in its network resulting in the potential exposure of up to 58 million accounts including usernames, email address and encrypted passwords.
[49] @011$ After revealing Assassin's Creed Unity at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, Ubisoft came in for criticism from the gaming community shortly after revealing that the game would not support female characters in co-op gameplay.
An updated version of the original Warcraft III mod DOTA, D2 is beautiful, challenging, very rewarding, deadly, frustrating (at times), deep and an extremely well-balanced team PvP game.
