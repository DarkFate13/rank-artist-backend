what is the best ubisoft game
This the best game of ubisoft ever I love it because of its incredible story, gameplay, free roam etc best game in the worldI am sure that this going to be liked by every one because it is the best part of the franchise @000$
Ubisoft's main attraction is that it puts games into historical moments. In this case, Ezio Auditore the Firenze, the protagonist of this game was able to travel through several Italian Renaissance cities, and each of the cities were as big as the cities back then, and had great detail. I don't think any other studio would make a game that takes place in the Renaissance. Most studios would just repeat the war FPS's. This game is unique, and is undoubtedly one of the best games of all time. @000$
Nothing, I mean no game beats te story of Assassins Creed 2. The gameplay is also one of the best and it became better through Brotherhood and Revelations. Only a true Assassin Creed fan would appreciate this. Undoubtedly the best Ubisoft game till date and among the best sandbox games ever made. @000$
Great storyline with exceptional visual effects which suits the whole game @000$
The most adventurous game I have ever played! I loved it very very much! @000$
Dafuq?!? It should be on top 5!1) AC 32) FC 33) AC Revelations4) Future Soldier5) Forgotten SandsAnd on...Then even Watch Dogs is coming out so every game I listed will shift 1 rank downSeriously guys, work on your ratings! @000$
One of the best game which I have ever played. It is much more better than Call of Duty, POP, Grand Theft Auto etc. It have best graphics and great gameplay. @000$
It's a best shooting game I ever played @000$
Great Game better than Assassin's Creed @000$
Great game, it is huge game with a huge map and tons of things to do and find. The world is so beautiful full of tropical islands. Countless treasure maps. Endless conflict with ships hunting animals sharks and giant Wales in a size of the ship. A plenty of upgrades on the ship makes it better and better. The story keeps you thinking. It is a catchy story with pirates that make it always wonder what will happen next @000$
Most of my favoarite game..i'm play all assassin's creed.. @000$
Even though if he's a pirate, he still deserves to be called an assassin. The best twist in the AC franchise. @000$
This game should be number 1, I mean ubisoft making an open world game like watch dogs wow guys best game ever @000$
The gameplay seems just epic @000$
Fake list this game should be number 1 @000$
I LIKE THIS GAME @000$

Best thing that's happened to assassin's creed since assassin's creed @000$
It's my first ubisoft game which I have played after it I have played several games of ubisoft but it's best @000$
Badass one but in my opinion, Far Cry 3 was better. I prefer Jason Brody than Ajay Gale. @000$
What is important for Ubisoft games is the soundtrack, you can't finish this game without leaving a tear. @000$
By far one of the greatest games of all time and this should be one and black flag should be at the bottom @000$
Amazing, better coop than in 3. @000$

Best game I ever played in assasin's Creed @000$

The best action-stealth video game ever - speed96 @000$
This game has not perfect movement that's the problem with this game @000$

Prince of Persia like never before. It is most daring unique, filled with surprise and thriller ever designed by ubisoft. It is breaking recording and make person more at unrest because he can't escape playing it. @000$
Wow chi ka w @000$
It's a good game but AC series is the best @000$
Awesome it's just the third series in the assasins creed Ezio's installment. @000$
That was the first one I played and I loved it @000$
Another masterpiece from a the modern day gaming power house... @000$
Great game but Ezio is much older. @000$
I like assassin creed @000$
Do you guys think this game sucks? I just asking... @000$
It is a very nice game @000$
Why isn't buck bumble for N64 on this list @000$
E for everyone? There's blood on rayman's hand more like E for evil! @000$
Two Thrones is a very good game even though it was made easier by speed kills. @000$
It doesn't contain high quality graphics, the game is very nice @000$
Liked this game very muchand worth giving a try! And story is also very good @000$
From the best game series ever made @000$
It's good because you can create your own gang @000$
Its hot. You get knifes, and brass knuckles @000$
It's the best game ever its one of ubisoft best games ever @000$
Its good game @000$
The best well planned game I ever played. @000$
This game will rock my worldThe first game that is going to attract my attention after call of dyty @000$
Probably my favourite shooter I have ever played. @000$
Become the Ghost Operator. @000$
Amazing game with amazing graphics and amazing story @000$
As an Iranian it's one of the best games I've ever played it's music was great and puzzles were well made I had the chance to know about this game when I was at my friend's house accidentally @000$
Played it as a kid. Loved climbing wall and wall running - Jonerman @000$
Prince of persia series 1.2.3 I can't believe how they make it. 10 of 10 @000$
I've finished it more than 30 times and it's the awesomest game ever! @000$
Prince of persia warrior within is a very nice game because it has best action and it has best music.But there is one small mistake that is in some places in prince of persia warrior within graphic quality will be little less @000$
The music, the story, the characters all took me to an unforgettable ride where I felt like the prince myself trying with all my heart to save my kaileena from DAHAKA... @000$
It doesn't deserve 19th place being one of the best made in this centrury. Come on AC above this? Graphics / parkour / nothing can overthrow the storyline and dark, immersive atmosphere of this masterpiece @000$
This game is so funny the games are creative and sometimes disgusting the only problem is that most of the games have you taking turns in multiplayer but this is still a great game @000$
Here you go,Gamer! @001$
Assassin’s Creed series @001$
Far Cry series(Its third installment is really something @001$
Tom clancy’s Splinter Cell series @001$
Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon @001$
Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Seige(Multiplayer) @001$
First of all, I am huge fan of ubisoft. They have made some of the most adventurous open world games. @001$
Currently the best game they have are, @001$
But most I am looking forward to is For Honor. @001$
They have made some sick game play n graphics. Do check out the trailer and gamescon game play, you will love it if you are ubisoft fan. @001$
So far, Assassin's Creed series and Far Cry 3&4 are the most well-acclaimed Ubisoft franchises. Not to forget the legendary Prince of Persia trilogy which revolutionised the gaming world. @001$
The only multiplayer Ubisoft game that still has a growing player base nearly a year and a half since release. @002$
Realistic first person shooter game, based on real special forces around the world and keeps growing to so much more! New operators and maps in place. Best online tactical game with co-ordination, thinking and being good on the guns is needed. Great game. @002$
This is the best first person shooter out there in terms of gameplay @002$
Fookin laser sights @002$
I love assassins creed and far cry but I spent over 20 hours this weekend playing the open beta. I can say without a doubt that I am going to be addicted to this game @002$
This should be on number 4 or something @002$
One of the first games I played both on XBox and PC absolutely love this game this game needs more people knowing it WHY IS IT SO UNDERRATED (same with Republic Commando) @002$
The start of famous series @002$
Am not gonna lie,this game deserves to be in top 5. @002$
Not the best but should be higher in the list @002$
This game has an amazing storyline. It has missions around the whole world with very realistic attacks with the best selection of weapons to any game. The characters are perfection E.G. Sam fisher, Charlie Cole. flaws: bad ending and always dark during gameplay without goggles. To conclude its one of Ubisofts best games god bless this company. @002$
Great game but Ubisoft doesn't provide after release support to update the game. When you open a ticket they just answer their automated answer "Thanks we noticed your report, we will transmit it".Result: - - If you uninstall and reinstall the game, you will have to replay again the full campaign to unlock all coop missions and unlock all items again and again. You multiplayer profile will be reseted to zero and you will have to play hours and hours to unlock items.- You can't unlock some items, because you can't login into the mobile application since 2014...- The multiplayer is full of cheaters since the start of the game... @002$
This masterpiece isn't easily forgotten, sadly enough it's placed very low on the list. With no offense in mind I think there's much of the assassins creed fanboism which brings it down. @002$
Amazing game! Except the game boy color version! @002$
Amazing game, overlooked too much! @002$
Legendary game @002$
This game has the stealth and parkour of assassins creed, the great outpost and hq take downs far cry, the seamless multiplayer missions of the division, and the extreme sports aspect of steep all packed into a pretty damn good open world to explore, discover, and find new hilarious ways to interact with. @002$
It's just great. @002$
This game is amazing @002$
I like this game so good creation @002$
Great game. Made me fall in love with the series and looking to get many other Ubisoft games. Love the outfits as well. @002$
People say that there are constant glitches. Well I have never experienced it - 2storm @002$
Can't wait for this and Far Cry 4 @002$
Great Game,fabulous graphics,i have never had any problems with glitches thanks to the patch. Ubisoft even gives you a free DLC. @002$
If you really need a quality game I am alive is one of the best from the graphics to everything you might need to play this game. Get you copy it available in xbox 360, playstations and pc @002$
I have played this over and over again, can't seem to forget it... @002$
I have completed this game 14 times lol @002$
Just baddas @002$
I used to go to a friends house, and we would play the crap out of this amazing game. @002$
Legends was great but origins has to be the best @002$
My favourite ubisoft game. And a little of nostalgia. @002$
I loved this game growing up. I wish they made a sequel to close up the plot holes @002$
The best light graphic game ever @002$
I had play hawx & hawx 2 and I like it more than ace combat because it's more realistic and I like that @002$

In 1986, five brothers began the French Revolution of video games, establishing a small development studio in the West of France. A series of fortunate events followed and before you knew it, Ubisoft was selling their wares across the globe and had studios set up in Shanghai, Montreal, and Germany. It's been gravy (and Rayman-sized cheese) ever since. Now, with 25 years under their belt, Ubisoft has become one of the top studios in the world, publishing hundreds and hundreds of games in the process. We enlisted our blindfold and darts resident listmakers to sift through their decades of work and put together the 10 uberest Ubisoft titles ever made. L'enveloppe, s'il vous plaît! @004$

30 years, 14 cherrypicked games - what's Ubisoft's greatest achievement? @005$
One of gaming's most prolific and storied developers, you've got Ubisoft to thank for everything from Rayman to Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell to Prince of Persia. Their 30 year history is one to be celebrated, and to this day they're currently revving the engines on Watch Dogs 2, For Honor and the SSX-aping STEEP, to name but three games coming in the next few months. @005$
But with such a huge amount of time at the top, what's actually their crowning achievement? @005$
We tend to think of studios like Rockstar and Naughty Dog, only for the likes of Grand Theft Auto/Red Dead or Uncharted/The Last of Us to pop up respectively. For Ubisoft though, their sheer size allows them to release a number of well-received and highly-regarded titles every year, potentially leaving no single standout. @005$
Or does it? Let me know what you think is Ubi's single greatest title (and their biggest mess) in the comments below, and here's to another 30 years going forward. @005$
Note: Only one game from each franchise has been chosen, unless there's a notable difference in quality to be worthy of inclusion more than once (like the below Assassin's Creed versus another in the list). @005$
Watch Dogs tends to spring to mind if you ruminate on monumental Ubisoft face-plants, but I put it to you that AC: Unity is worse in every respect. @005$
See, where Watch Dogs was actually playable, Unity released as a broken mess - one that to this day, Ubi have never fully rectified, despite releasing a 150GB patch to replace the Xbox One version entirely. @005$
There's also the fact that Unity was supposed to be the game that convinced us of "the next generation of Assassin's Creed", with the devs routinely touting the fact they'd built an entire new engine, with "all-new animations" - the standard "It's a whole new way to play" routine. @005$
But what did that amount to? @005$
Well, we got a 'descend' button you could hold to freak the camera out, and... nothing else. It played exactly the same, looked gorgeous in spots but completely absurd in others, all-round being the one title that put the nail in the Assassin's Creed coffin, after the casket was already closing shut. @005$

There are some video game studios out there whose games all have a unifying characteristic. Their gameplay, look, and genre are all so alike that it’s a no-brainer that they were developed by the same team. Other developers are more well-known for their diversity, their wide range of genres, and their big catalogue of brands. Ubisoft is certainly a studio of the latter kind. The defining traits of Ubisoft games are their high quality and their high production value. Founded in 1986, the French video game developer and publisher is certainly also one of the defining institutions in the video game industry. Never missing a new innovation, the studio was quick to explore new technologies and embrace them. With the advances of online gaming and mobile gaming, Ubisoft has made sure to never fall behind. Today, it is one of the largest independent publishers of video games worldwide, and we here at SevenGames.com have a wide array of their titles on our website! @008$
If you like to play free games in the browser of your choice, Ubisoft will be a safe bet. The studio has released several browser games over the course of the last few years. If you happen to be looking for a fun and high quality free-to-play game for your browser, you should take a peek at Ubisoft games. The developer puts a great focus on releasing browser games that do not follow a pay-to-win business model. Instead, its titles are fair and well-balanced. Games such as Anno Online, The Settlers Online, and Panzer General Online have brought established franchises to online gaming. These are the most popular genres for Ubisoft’s browser games: @008$
Another major branch of Ubisoft games on SevenGames.com are online games. These free titles have established new IPs in the studio’s portfolio. Particularly the quirky humor of The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot has opened an entirely new door for the publisher resulting in the continuous development of more free games. While most online games have to be downloaded first, they usually also offer a more immersive gaming world with detailed 3D graphics. @008$
In more recent years, the game developer’s major focus has been mobile gaming. Particularly established franchises have found their way to players’ smartphones and tablets. Rayman, Assassin’s Creed, and Anno have all gotten their very own apps. Ubisoft has also made sure to mix it up with brand-new IPs developed specifically for mobile devices. Below you will find some of the core features of Ubisoft mobile games: @008$

About thirty years ago, five brothers from the Guillemot family laid the foundations of what would become one of the most eminent and influential video game studios of modern gaming. Ubisoft established its roots in Carentoir, a small village in the West of France. Three decades afterwards, with an admirable number of games under its belt, Ubisoft has become a video game publisher of commendable and widespread repute. @010$
Here we enlist the 10 best games Ubisoft has produced during its thirty years of existence: @010$
Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege – Gameplay Trailer Fall 2015 @010$
The long-awaited successor to the cancelled Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots was met with favorable reception albeit opinions altered regarding the game’s merits and defects, the chief complaint being the game’s unsatisfactory content that leaves players wanting as well as minor issues which frequent online multiplayer shooters such as clunky map rotation and a shortage of in-game communication tools for console players. @010$
In spite of these shortcomings, Rainbow Six Siege has set an example for other modern shooters with its unprecedented tactical depth, adrenalin-imbued, heart-pounding exultation at the knowledge that you’re fighting for your life as there are no respawns or health regeneration in addition to its compass of creative team play. @010$
For Honor - World Premiere Trailer - E3 2015 @010$
Since its announcement during last year’s E3 press conference, the upcoming action hack and slash video game has constantly pervaded player minds. With a scheduled release date in February 14th, 2017, For Honor is a union of actual human history and epic fictional fantasy that will represent a breath of fresh air in gaming. Instead of another extreme multiplayer shooter, Ubisoft substitutes guns with strenuous third-person sword fighting, a multi-faction badass campaign coupled with methodical, thought-provoking, challenging gameplay as you enter the battlefield as a merciless Viking, agile Samurai or chivalric Knight. @010$
Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands Reveal Trailer – E3 2015 @010$
Set for a March 7th, 2017 release, the anticipated follow-up to the 2012 tactical squad-based shooter Future Soldier has the underlying potential to skyrocket the series to new heights. @010$
Wildlands has all the compulsory ingredients to become a revolutionary entry to the Ghost Recon series and a unique reimagining of shooters like Infinite Warfare, with its alluring storyline, astonishing graphics, a modern-day setting and promising open-world approach with a plethora of side missions and areas just begging for exploration, reminiscent of Far Cry and Grand Theft Auto. @010$
Altair using the iconic Eagle Vision to scan his surroundings. @010$
One of gaming’s best-selling and universally-acknowledged franchises traces its beginnings nearly a decade ago, when the first Assassin’s Creed debuted with a stellar opening number and an outburst of awe. @010$
Through the years, the series expanded with its annual release of main games, spin-offs, comics and novelizations. The first Assassin’s Creed is nowadays regarded as a classic, its indispensable influence in the series is felt to this day, despite the game’s rough initial reception, with critics describing it as a squandered potential due to creative errors on Ubisoft’s part, the repetitive gameplay, underdeveloped story and buggy AI. @010$
Approximately ten years since its release, fans of the Assassin’s Creed franchise fondly reminisce about the game, the most firmly-embedded memories being the memorable protagonist, the well-researched and beautifully-crafted historical cities and the breadth of exploratory open space. @010$
Assassin's Creed Revelations - E3 Trailer Extended Cut @010$
Back in 2011, Assassin’s Creed: Revelations was regarded as the most compelling entry in the series, bringing a faithful and heartfelt closure to gaming’s two most memorable protagonists - Ezio Auditore and Altair Ibn-La'Ahad. @010$
From a narrative point of view, Ubisoft’s ambition is commendable and praiseworthy, as the game strives for equipoise and emotional depth while going back-and-forth between the two characters, tying up all loose ends from previous games. In the end, Ubisoft’s efforts paid off adequately, its strongly developed characters, convincing voice acting, masterful soundtrack and stunning visual design made Revelations the pinnacle of the series’ storytelling method in 2011, despite the fact the game hasn’t revolutionized any of the game’s core aspects which have remained repetitive and worn-out for many years. @010$
Rayman stoutly faces his foes. @010$
A sequel to one of 2011’s best games, Rayman Origins, Rayman Legends offers an over-sufficient quantity of creative content over the course of its twelve hours of gameplay. One of the best Rayman games ever released according to critics, the game lives up to both fan expectations and the quality of its predecessors. Its stunning and diverse level design, unpredictable but delightful in-game moments, the outstanding co-op-based gameplay and the dozens of unlockable items make Rayman Legends a bundle of creativity and a refreshing experience for both children and adults. @010$
An RPG adaptation based on the American adult animated television series South Park. @010$
While it doesn’t elevate to the same pedestal as other RPG games, South Park: The Stick of Truth is still meritorious as it retains the spirit and humor of its high repute television counterpart. A very respectable RPG in its own right with lengthy customization options and turn-based combat, The Stick of Truth feels more like an interactive South Park movie. The player feels engaged throughout the scope of the game, ensnared by a delightful main story and side quests, which are legitimately funny to the very end. @010$
Far Cry 3: The Story Trailer @010$
Following its release in 2012, Far Cry 3 skillfully built upon the formula from its two preceding games, rapidly becoming one of 2012’s most commercially successful open-world titles. @010$
Far Cry 3 is a mature, tempestuous and unpredictable story featuring flawed, morally grey, complex leading heroes and anti-heroes. Protagonist Jason Brody’s believable character development from insipid young man to bedlam-inclined lunatic and Vaas Montenegro’s chilling psychopathic mien, all that copulated with the tropical splendor of Rook Island and a vehemently combat system that inclines you to do incredibly violent acts, makes Far Cry 3 an impetuous gaming experience that will long remain interred in your memory. @010$
Splinter Cell: Blacklist - Launch Trailer @010$
Splinter Cell: Blacklist represents a mirror of a different side of Sam Fisher; while Splinter Cell: Conviction was a personal story, Blacklist emphasizes not who Sam is, but what he does. The storyline is an intermingle of the domineering elements from its predecessors, which made Blacklist’s narrative unique, but poorly executed and often repetitive. @010$
However, there is no doubt or error regarding the game’s exemplary multiplayer mode, enrapturing side-missions, diverse set of gadgets and stunning visual imagery. @010$
Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag - Official Launch Trailer @010$
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is the second addition to the series’ so-called Kenway Saga, after 2012’s Assassin’s Creed III. Despite its predecessor’s mixed reception. Black Flag is a masterfully-crafted, flexible and queer entry to the Assassin’s Creed series featuring one of its most unique, divergent historical settings and heroes. @010$
Starring fan-favorite Welsh privateer-turned-pirate assassin Edward Kenway, grandfather to Assassin’s Creed III’s leading hero Connor, the player is thrust into the synesthetic beauty of The Caribbean, traversing its uncharted and unconventional islands brimming with enough satisfactory content that will keep you engaged more than any other Assassin’s Creed game. @010$
Three years since its release, Black Flag has remained the series’ most acclaimed and fan-favorite title along with the vigorous Assassin’s Creed II. It’s a smart and innovative entry which players go back to again and again, revisiting the radiant Caribbean realm and lush jungles imbued with amazing secrets relating to the Assassin Order and an indefatigable number of ships to plunder. @010$
From Assassin’s Creed to Far Cry, from Ghost Recon to Splinter Cell, Ubisoft has delivered various, memorable titles over the years and its fans are eager for many extravagant tales in the years to come. @010$

Ubisoft Entertainment SA (formerly Ubi Soft Entertainment Software) is a French video game publisher, headquartered in Rennes, France. It is known for publishing games for several acclaimed video game franchises including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Just Dance, Prince of Persia, Rayman, and Tom Clancy's. It is the fourth largest publicly-traded game company in the Americas and Europe after Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, and Take-Two Interactive in terms of revenue and market capitalization.[4] @011$
In March 1986, five brothers of the Guillemot family founded Ubi Soft in Carentoir, a small village located in the Morbihan department of the Brittany region in France.[5] Yves Guillemot soon made deals with Electronic Arts, Sierra On-Line, and MicroProse to distribute their games in France. By the end of the decade, Ubi Soft began expanding to other markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. They entered the video game distribution and wholesale markets, and by 1993 they had become the largest distributor of video games in France.[6] In the early 1990s, Ubi Soft initiated its in-house game development program, which led to the 1994 opening of a studio in Montreuil, France. It later became their administrative and commercial head office, even as the company continues to register its headquarters in Rennes. Ubi Soft became a publicly traded company in 1996 and continued its expansion around the globe, opening locations in Annecy (1996), Shanghai (1996), Montreal (1997), and Milan (1998). @011$
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Ubi Soft committed itself to online games by supporting Uru: Ages Beyond Myst, The Matrix Online, and the European and Chinese operation of EverQuest. The publisher established an online division. However, in February 2004, Ubisoft cancelled the online portion of Uru and backed out of the publishing deal on The Matrix Online. The company is noted for its teams of female game developers/testers, known as the Frag Dolls. @011$
In March 2001, Gores Technology Group sold The Learning Company's entertainment division (which includes games originally published by Brøderbund, Mattel, Mindscape and Strategic Simulations) to them. The sale included the rights to intellectual properties such as the Myst and Prince of Persia series.[7] In July 2006, Ubisoft bought the Driver franchise from Atari for a sum of €19 million in cash for the franchise, technology rights, and most assets. In July 2008, Ubisoft made the acquisition of Hybride Technologies, a Piedmont-based studio renowned for its expertise in the creation of visual effects for cinema, television and advertising. In November 2008, Ubisoft acquired Massive Entertainment from Activision.[8] In January 2013, Ubisoft acquired South Park: The Stick of Truth from THQ for $3.265 million. @011$
In September 2003, Ubi Soft announced that that they would change their name to simply Ubisoft, and introduced a new logo known as "the Swirl", that would be left unchanged until 2017. @011$
In December 2004, rival gaming corporation Electronic Arts purchased a 19.9% stake in the firm, an action Ubisoft referred to as "hostile" on EA's part.[9] @011$
Ubisoft announced plans in 2013 to invest $373 million into its Quebec operations over seven years, a move that will generate 500 additional jobs in the province. The publisher is investing in the expansion of its motion capture technologies, and consolidating its online games operations and infrastructure in Montreal. The significant investment is expected to generate 500 jobs in Quebec over a seven-year period. By 2020, the company will employ more than 3,500 staff at its studios in Montreal and Quebec City.[10] @011$
In March 2015, the company set up a Consumer Relationship Centre in Newcastle upon Tyne. The centre is intended to integrate consumer support teams and community managers. Consumer Support and Community Management teams at the CRC are operational seven days a week.[11] @011$
In May 2017, Ubisoft announced that they had changed their logo to a simplistic, minimalistic version of the former representation.[12] @011$
Since around 2015, the French mass media company Vivendi has been seeking to expand its media properties through acquisitions and other business deals. In addition to advertising firm Havas, Ubisoft was one of the first target properties identified by Vivendi, which as of September 2017 has an estimated valuation of $6.4 billion.[13][14] Vivendi, in two separate actions during October 2015, bought shares in Ubisoft stock, giving them a 10.4% stake in Ubisoft, an action that Yves Guillemot considered "unwelcome" and feared a hostile takeover.[15] In a presentation during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016, Yves Guillemot stressed the importance that Ubisoft remain an independent company to maintain its creative freedom.[16] @011$
Vivendi also acquired stake in mobile game publisher Gameloft, also owned by the Guillemots, at the same time it started acquiring Ubisoft shares.[17][15] In the following February, Vivendi acquired €500 million worth of shares in Gameloft, gaining more than 30% of the shares and requiring the company under French law to make a public tender offer; this action enabled Vivendi to complete the hostile takeover of Gameloft by June 2016.[18][19][20] Following Vivendi's actions with Gameloft in February 2016, the Guillemots asked for more Canadian investors in the following February to fend off a similar Vivendi takeover;[21][22][23] by this point, Vivendi had increased their share in Ubisoft to 15%, exceeding the estimated 9% that the Guillemots owned.[19][21] By mid-June 2016, Vivendi had increased its shares to 20.1%, but denied it was in the process of a takeover.[24] @011$
By the time of Ubisoft's annual board meeting in September 2016, Vivendi has gained 23% of the shares, while Guillemots were able to increase their voting share to 20%. A request was made at the board meeting to place Vivendi representatives on Ubisoft's board, given the size of their share holdings. The Guillemots argued strongly against this, reiterating that Vivendi should be seen as a competitor, and succeeded in swaying other voting members to deny any board seats to Vivendi.[25] @011$
Vivendi continued to buy shares in Ubisoft, approaching the 30% mark that could trigger a hostile takeover; as of December 2016, Vivendi held a 27.15% stake in Ubisoft.[26] Reuters reported in April 2017 that Vivendi's takeover of Ubisoft would likely happen that year,[13] and Bloomberg Businessweek observed that some of Vivendi's shares would reach the two-year holding mark, which would grant them double voting power, and would likely meet or exceed the 30% threshold.[27] The Guillemot family has since raised their stake in Ubisoft; as of June 2017, the family now held 13.6 percent of Ubisoft's share capital, and 20.02 percent of the company's voting rights.[28] @011$
Besides publishing their own games, Ubisoft is also publishing famous franchises produced by other important studios for some specific platforms. @011$
Uplay is a digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer and communications service for PC created by Ubisoft. @011$
Ubisoft Club is a reward program. Members earn rewards by completing certain actions while playing games published by Ubisoft. Completing an action gives you a certain amount of Units, which members can use to unlock those rewards or to get a discount on games from the Uplay Store. @011$
Ubisoft had, for a time, used the controversial StarForce copy protection technology that installs drivers on a system and is known to cause hardware and compatibility issues with certain operating systems. On 14 April 2006, Ubisoft confirmed that they would stop using StarForce on their games, citing complaints from customers.[37] @011$
In August 2008, Ubisoft was criticized by an antiwar group for its role as a developer of propaganda and recruitment tools for the U.S. Department of Defense.[38] @011$
In January 2010, Ubisoft announced the online services platform Uplay, which forces customers to not only authenticate on the first game launch, but to remain online continually while playing, with the game even pausing if network connection is lost. This makes it impossible to play the game offline, to resell it, and meaning that, should Ubisoft's servers go down, the game will be unplayable. In 2010, review versions of Assassin's Creed II and Settlers 7 for the PC contained this new DRM scheme, confirming that it is already in use, and that instead of pausing the game, it would discard all progress since the last checkpoint or save game.[39] However, subsequent patches for Assassin's Creed II allow the player to continue playing once their connection has been restored without lost progress.[40] @011$
In March 2010, outages to the Ubisoft DRM servers were reported, causing about 5% of legitimate buyers to be unable to play Assassin's Creed II and Silent Hunter 5.[41][42] Ubisoft initially announced this was the result of the number of users attempting to access their servers to play, but later claimed that the real cause of the outages were denial-of-service attacks.[41][42] In August 2011, Ubisoft released From Dust with DRM protection, contrary to previous statements that the game would not have any DRM related restrictions. After several months, the DRM had still not been removed from copies of the game.[43] @011$
In the February 2008 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, editor-in-chief Dan "EGMShoe" Hsu asserted that Ubisoft had ceased to provide Ubisoft titles to EGM for coverage purposes as a result of prior critical previews and negative reviews.[44][45] Yves Guillemot, the CEO of Ubisoft, was quoted in the company's third-quarter 2008–09 sales report as saying "as some of our games did not meet the required quality levels to achieve their full potential, they need more sales promotions than anticipated."[46] The company's use of Aaron Priceman, also known as Mr. Caffeine by the internet, as a spokesman at E3 2011 was criticized for his reliance on popular internet references, inability to pronounce Tom Clancy (he pronounced it "Tom Culancy"), sexual innuendos and imitations of video game sound effects with little to no response from the audience.[47] @011$
On 2 July 2013, Ubisoft announced a major breach in its network resulting in the potential exposure of up to 58 million accounts including usernames, email address and encrypted passwords. Although the firm denied any credit/debit card information could have been compromised, it issued directives to all registered users to change their account passwords and also recommended updating passwords on any other website or service where a same or similar password had been used.[48] All the users who registered were emailed by the Ubisoft company about the breach and a password change request. Ubisoft promised to keep the information safe.[49] @011$
After revealing Assassin's Creed Unity at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, Ubisoft came in for criticism from the gaming community shortly after revealing that the game would not support female characters in co-op gameplay. The criticism was inflamed after they explained the absence of a female co-op or playable character in Far Cry 4: according to Ubisoft Montreal, they were close to making it possible when the decision was taken that they didn't have the right animations for a female character.[50] Among the responses were comments from developers that the explanations given were not valid. Among them were the fact that the protagonists of Assassin's Creed III and its spin-off game Liberation shared a large amount of movement animations. There were also statements that characters in video games tended to move in a similar fashion regardless of gender.[51] An animation director for Assassin's Creed III also said that the stated reasons of workload and animation replacement didn't hold up, saying that it would be "a day or two's work" to create a female character model.[50] @011$
The question was simple: What are your favorite games of 2013? Oh, sure, there were “rules.” You can only pick three. They must be from 2013. They can’t be our own games. But as you might expect from some of our top developers, the rules were bound to be bent. A few picked games that came out earlier than 2013, protesting that these are the very games they’re still playing religiously; others had a tough time winnowing down their list to a mere trio. But rather than getting all the entries to conform to a one-size-fits-all template, we thought it’d be more fun to just share with you what nine of our developers consider (in their own words) the very best non-Ubisoft games they played last year. And because you love games as much as we do, be sure to let us know in the comments below what your faves are too. @012$
The Last of Us Incredibly well-executed game on every front. From storytelling and cinematics to the level design, pacing and more, all of it is topnotch. This is incredibly difficult to achieve and something that I have the utmost respect for. Besides that, I had a blast playing through the experience! @012$
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons I love when games try something new and out of the box. But even more wonderful is when the narrative and the mechanics push you to feel and live the story more powerfully through the game systems. This was the allure of Brothers. The relationship between the characters is represented in the controls and puzzles of the game, which helped make this a big hit for me! @012$
Path of Exile I love action-RPGs, and this one surprised me – specifically, how intense and complex the skill system is. You can create virtually any type of character you want. There is a lot of exploration and investment to do in this system and it gives an insane amount of replay value. At the end of the day this game created its own strong identity even if it may superficially look like a Diablo clone. It is definitely not! @012$
Grand Theft Auto V This is game craftsmanship to a level that I’ve never seen before. The attention to detail is mind-blowing. From your GPS that doesn’t work when you’re in a tunnel to the sandals that flip and flop when you walk, everything in the game is just crazy. Usually, a game has to cut a few corners without the player noticing. Grand Theft Auto V flipped that and said, No, we’re going to care about everything. @012$
The details don’t just matter because they’re beautiful. You want to love things, but why would I care about something that the creator didn’t care about? In GTAV, it felt like the people who made it cared about the details and put in the effort for all those little details. That’s on top of the systems in the game working really well and the story being great and the characters being entertaining. But the attention to detail and the level of craftsmanship in GTAV definitely made it my game of the year. @012$
Rogue Legacy These days I’m really interested in games that change the way games are structured. Rogue Legacy is a roguelike game. That means you’ll play it, you’ll die, and then you spend the money you earned to improve your character… then play again and hopefully make it a bit further before dying again and repeating the process. You’re always replaying a different map because all the maps are randomly generated. But Rogue Legacy is, in some ways, more about the meta game surrounding the game than the actual gameplay. I really like games that do that. Rogue Legacy is definitely a game that did that well. I’m still playing it now. @012$
Borderlands 2 A lot of the games I play are co-op games. I have a great friend and we play multiple times a week together (that is, when we’re not working too much on the game we’re making). We try to play every big co-op game together and Borderlands 2 is one that we both put over 100 hours into. The gameplay is simple enough that you can jump in and be talking about other things in the real world and still be enjoying the game – and then there are these moments where the game spikes up the difficulty and you hit a boss and you have to focus on co-op strategy and tactics. The gameplay has the perfect level of depth. It’s deep enough that you’re leveling up a lot and becoming better and getting better guns, but at the same time the subject is light and really funny. It’s the type of game that when you’ve spent 12 hours at work, you can just go home and play a couple of hours, then maybe go to bed without a headache that night. It’s one of my favorite co-op games. @012$
DOTA 2 Quite simply DOTA 2 is the best MOBA developed to date. An updated version of the original Warcraft III mod DOTA, D2 is beautiful, challenging, very rewarding, deadly, frustrating (at times), deep and an extremely well-balanced team PvP game. @012$
Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft What League of Legends is to its inspiration (DOTA), Blizzard’s Hearthstone is to Magic the Gathering.  Meshing the collectable card gameplay of Magic the Gathering with World of Warcraft–themed classes and spells, Hearthstone is very easy to get into but has some surprising depth with class and card synergies. But most importantly it’s just a flat-out blast to play! @012$
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Really set the bar for me personally for open-world RPG immersion, exploration and character choice. They do a great job at delivering with a triple-A main storyline while not forcing their players along any one path of the game. It is up to you as a player how and where you want to adventure. (I know that the game has not been released in 2013, but I’ve spent lot of time on it this year!) @012$
The Last of Us As an animator you can’t help but admire Naughty Dog for creating such a gorgeous game with amazing character animation. The interaction between Joel and Ellie in the world they crafted was riveting, and the scenes were so believable I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. @012$
Grand Theft Auto V There’s just nothing quite like GTAV. Every single mission was so well done with tons of custom gameplay driven along by a nice relationship between Trevor, Michael and Franklin. The mission design in particular was stellar because we often started out with one objective but the characters progressively complicate their lives leading to something surprising. I lost a lot of hours just exploring the world, and I had a big smile on my face while cruising around a virtual Venice Beach. @012$
Dishonored I was extremely interested in Dishonored as soon as I first saw the previews, and I fell in love with the world they were creating. There is a very nice exaggeration and attention to detail that makes the world feel so rich and atmospheric. The real beauty of this game, however, is the ability to face each situation in so many unique and creative ways. @012$
Grand Theft Auto V This was a highly anticipated game and in my mind Rockstar didn’t disappoint. I’ve been a fan of the GTA series from the very first 2D top-down version on the PlayStation. I was a little worried about the game following three different characters for the first time, but it really delivered. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and some of the choices you had to make. After the initial teething problems of GTA Online, I had hours more fun just driving around with friends robbing liquor stores, racing one another and avoiding being taken out by other players. @012$
Payday 2 Hands down one of the best shooters of the year. What’s not to love about discussing tactics and tricks before the heist begins, followed by the tension that builds as you get into position, and then remaining inconspicuous before putting the mask on and shouting at people to get on the ground. Some of the best games I’ve had were when I try not to raise any alarms and do the job quietly. Of the four different classes I mainly specialized in the Technician. What can I say, I like explosives! @012$
Don’t Starve I was late to discover how much fun Don’t Starve is, but so glad a community member recommended it to me. It’s a very freeform game in which (as the title suggests) the main goal is to not starve to death. You have to survive an increasingly harsh environment that has seasonal weather, nasty monsters… and “Charlie,” the thing that lives within the darkness that comes for you. It’s quite unforgiving, but this game is really about learning from your mistakes for the next playthrough, which makes you want to try again to survive just one more day from your previous record. @012$
Save the Date Short and sweet, Save the Date reinvents the adventure game as a lexical open-world experience. Add to that one of the most engaging, real female characters I’ve seen in a game in ages and a very touching meta final act and you have my game of the year. @012$
The Stanley Parable Explodes the stale tropes of modern videogames, while questioning the meaning of freedom and storytelling itself with rapier-sharp wit. @012$
Year Walk  / Device 6 These rich journeys dripping with mood and style were both released by Simogo, which published my two favorite iOS games this year. Not only a brilliant implementation of touch mechanics, these games explore all the different mechanisms that can possibly create narrative and puzzles on iOS, even using a second app to tell part of the story. @012$
Saints Row IV No other game so fully embraced the fun of being a game this year. Mix great gameplay with the winking, cheerful self-awareness of things like “Nolan North Mode” and a gonzo storyline that mashes up everything from They Live to Paula Abdul videos into a glorious narrative gumbo, and you get a level of pure, unapologetic entertainment. Also, run-on sentences, but that’s the sort of dizzying abandon the game inspired in me. @012$
Papers, Please And on the other end of the spectrum, we have a Kafka-esque nightmare of moral murk and impossible choices. Taking player expectation of clear rules and defined rewards for following those rules – then smashing them head-on into human corruption, greed and desperation – created the same investment in player decision-making that Wolf Among Us and The Walking Dead (two more games I loved) asked for, without the distancing factor of a supernatural setting. Quieter in some ways than Gone Home, but just as emotionally devastating. @012$
“AAA Games That Took Narrative Elements Seriously As Part Of The Player Experience As If It Were Always Supposed To Be That Way And Didn’t Spend Tons Of Time Shouting LOOK SHINY NARRATIVE!” As for a third game, let me instead propose the above category. After all, we got a whole bunch of non-RPG games this year – from the Tomb Raider reboot to The Last of Us to Bioshock Infinite – that started from the premise that good narrative was an intrinsic part of the player experience and not something to be bolted on, called out, or separated from what the player did minute to minute. By taking for granted the fact that gameplay and narrative work together for the player’s benefit, they pushed the paradigm toward a better, more interesting place. Maybe it’s a cop-out not to name one in particular, but I think the trend as a whole is worth recognizing, and having each of those titles out there made the others stronger. @012$
Grand Theft Auto V Difficult to deny that Rockstar raised the bar this year. From taking down high-end jewelry stores to rappelling down elevator shafts of burning skyscrapers, the game had enough action sequences for four Hollywood blockbusters. But the moments that really got me were the quieter ones: the flights over lakes, the yoga on mountain tops, the discovery of a pot farm while driving off road aimlessly. @012$
The narrative is a blast but once you’ve exhausted its charms, there’s a whole new world of mayhem to discover. Not only is the sandbox one of the most fleshed out and coherent ever created, but GTA Online could be the gateway drug to MMOs that console players were waiting for. @012$
The ambition, scope and execution blow me away every time I revisit it. @012$
The Last Of Us Ellie. Infected. Shivs. Shotguns. Dave. The Giraffe. Ellie! @012$
Combo Crew “Combo Crew could very well be the definitive beat-em up of the mobile age of gaming,” said Kotaku, and who am I to disagree? Swipes, taps and finger gymnastics make for a rhythmic brawler that draws inspiration from our old-school classics. Cherry on the cake? Ryu, Chun-Li and Blanca can all be played (Ken, too, but who cares). @012$
OK, full disclosure: my wife and a good ex-Ubi friend are behind the title… Both of them are tougher than me so I had to feature it. So if I had to choose another game it would be Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon (bending the rules again). Only rarely does a game embrace pop culture so well (even down to the gun designs!) that it creates a trend (see a recent kickstarter) and that should be celebrated. @012$
“Compelling Choice and Storytelling” Ever since reading Choose Your Own Adventure books as a child, I’ve been dying to make meaningful choices in games. The Walking Dead did it for me last year, but there were two big surprises for me in 2013. @012$
The Stanley Parable turned out to be a game completely about making choices, and though them, you unfold the ridiculously clever and tremendously entertaining narrative in increasingly surprising ways. Never before have I played a game simply about walking through doors that kept me as engaged as The Stanley Parable has. And I still haven’t seen every ending it has to offer. @012$
Papers, Please manages to take the most unappealing job in the world – immigration officer for the fictional Eastern European country of Arstotzka – and turn it into a compelling and surprisingly challenging puzzle game. But even more impressive, the game has one of the most engaging narratives of any I’ve ever played. It forced me to make tough but meaningful choices every five minutes. Ones that could mean the life or death of my family, or even land me in Arstotzkan jail for treason. @012$
Having choices in games has been done before, but notably neither of these two games makes use of dialogue trees or other intrusive user-interface to achieve it. They simply let you play the game the way you want, and adapt as the world reacts to your actions. For me, they’re modern works of art, and a testament to the power of videogames. @012$
“The Game That Compelled Me to 100% the Thing” Guacamelee is the perfect combination of Castlevania meets Metroid meets side-scrolling brawler… meets Mexico. The humor is as subtle and lovely as the art style, and the fluidity in the combination of platforming and combat is incredibly satisfying. The completist in me just couldn’t keep myself from finding every last hidden secret in the game, and I swear I didn’t even use a walkthrough to do it (this time). @012$
“The Game That’s So Fast I Don’t Even Know What Just Happened” Hotline Miami was a huge surprise for me, because it’s been a long time since a game has been so brutally punishing and unpredictably fast… and it’s way too fun for its own good. With its trippy colors, ambiguous story and amazing soundtrack, Hotline Miami is, as a complete package, an experience incomparable with any other I’ve had in the past. @012$
Gary Steinman has won numerous editorial awards, but you probably don’t care about that. He also ran multiple industry leading publications and websites including PlayStation: The Official Magazine, GamesRadar.com, PC Gamer and Newtype USA – but that’s all in the past. The real truth about Gary? He loves cats, he takes too many selfies on Facebook (according to one co-worker, at least), and he occasionally crochets. And now he’s helping share stories about Ubisoft’s amazing games and their incredible creators in his role overseeing the UbiBlog and other select Ubisoft social channels.
