30 years, 14 cherrypicked games - what's Ubisoft's greatest achievement?

One of gaming's most prolific and storied developers, you've got Ubisoft to thank for everything from Rayman to Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell to Prince of Persia. Their 30 year history is one to be celebrated, and to this day they're currently revving the engines on Watch Dogs 2, For Honor and the SSX-aping STEEP, to name but three games coming in the next few months.

But with such a huge amount of time at the top, what's actually their crowning achievement?

We tend to think of studios like Rockstar and Naughty Dog, only for the likes of Grand Theft Auto/Red Dead or Uncharted/The Last of Us to pop up respectively. For Ubisoft though, their sheer size allows them to release a number of well-received and highly-regarded titles every year, potentially leaving no single standout.

Or does it? Let me know what you think is Ubi's single greatest title (and their biggest mess) in the comments below, and here's to another 30 years going forward.

Note: Only one game from each franchise has been chosen, unless there's a notable difference in quality to be worthy of inclusion more than once (like the below Assassin's Creed versus another in the list).

--

Watch Dogs tends to spring to mind if you ruminate on monumental Ubisoft face-plants, but I put it to you that AC: Unity is worse in every respect.

See, where Watch Dogs was actually playable, Unity released as a broken mess - one that to this day, Ubi have never fully rectified, despite releasing a 150GB patch to replace the Xbox One version entirely.

There's also the fact that Unity was supposed to be the game that convinced us of "the next generation of Assassin's Creed", with the devs routinely touting the fact they'd built an entire new engine, with "all-new animations" - the standard "It's a whole new way to play" routine.

But what did that amount to?

Well, we got a 'descend' button you could hold to freak the camera out, and... nothing else. It played exactly the same, looked gorgeous in spots but completely absurd in others, all-round being the one title that put the nail in the Assassin's Creed coffin, after the casket was already closing shut.
